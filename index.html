            <p>October is probably my favorite month of the year – and it’s not just because it’s my birthday. The cool air of fall and the general whimsy of what I like to call “getting my academic on” puts a slight pep in my step as I finally get the chance to put on my flannels I’ve stockpiled all summer. Although it seems to be the opposite, as eventually the beautiful warm hues whither from the trees, fall is the season of growth in my eyes. As a student, the year really starts in September, and so the fall functions as my time to put those summer resolutions into action. This excitement culminates with the gloom of Halloween, an evening (or, a very long weekend if you’re on a college campus) when the cold air battles to pull you into despair while you hold on to the adrenaline rush of facing metaphorical or even literal fears. Yeah, I honestly think Halloween is the most romantic holiday of the year.</p>
            
            <p>To soundtrack this season of melancholy and growth, I’d like to turn my attention towards one of my favorite albums ever: <em>How to Leave Town</em> by Car Seat Headrest. By the end of this month, it will have been exactly ten years since this album first released. To celebrate, I’m working on an article for Impact 89FM that dissects the album's lyrical themes and how much it means to me. If you aren’t familiar with the album or the band as a whole, Headrest is an indie-rock group that started out as just one guy, Will Toledo, before he became a festival sensation. This album was the final record released before he signed to Matador Records, acting as a send off to his early lo-fi era. Jam-packed with existential pleas, self-referential quips, and an unrivaled storytelling ability, I can’t imagine the fall season without this album. Check out the tracklist below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Ending of Dramamine – 14:17</li> 
                <li>Beast Monster Thing (Love Isn't Love Enough) – 6:49 
                <li>Kimochi Warui (When? When? When? When? When? When? When?) – 4:44</li>
                <li>I-94 W (832 mi) – 1:26</li>
                <li>You're in Love With Me – 5:42</li>
                <li>America (Never Been) – 7:15</li> 
                <li>I Want You to Know That I'm Awake/I Hope That You're Asleep – 8:43</li>
                <li>Is This Dust Really From the Titanic? – 1:57</li>
                <li>Hey, Space Cadet (Beast Monster Thing In Space) – 11:26</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I’ll keep updating this page with my updates and thoughts on the album, as well as any other music I find to capture fall at its best. Stay tuned…</p>

            <h2>Frankenstein, Poetry, and the Death of the Author</h2>

            <p>Recently, I reread Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, as my gorgeous Barnes and Noble copy sat on my shelf for far too long and I figured there was no better time of the year than now to sink back into it. To make it clear, I adore this book. I was effortlessly captivated by it the first time I read it in high school and that infatuation has yet to extinguish. How is Shelley capable of crafting such dramatic and eloquent sentences with ease? The language is hypnotizing, not even mentioning the narrative itself. Upon logging my progress on Goodreads (a reading tracker app), I found that perhaps my love for this novel is not consistent with everyone. I stumbled upon a review from a person who declared their abhorrence for the novel as deeply as Frankenstein himself scorned at his own creation. They proclaimed a lack of care for the narrative itself, but most importantly, they were repelled by the language Shelley uses.</p>

            <p>This negativity that seemed to be a relatively common opinion for a portion of readers struck me as revolutionary. As a writer who journals often and can spend an hour wafting on one word to use in a line of a poem, language is the difference between something being just “okay” and “amazing”. As I aspire to publish my own writings one day, I wonder if there is an audience that would even care to hear what I say. I do not consider myself to be the greatest writer by any means – most of my work dabbles between stream-of-consciousness rambles and loosely structured dreams – but is an attempt at genuine artistic integrity not enough? Oh boy, I haven’t even mentioned the concern of generative AI! I am optimistic that this negative review – who, might I add, is completely valid in their criticism of literature and their own enjoyment of the novel – is not a reflection of a general anti-intellectual movement but of a small minority. I dearly hope so.</p>
