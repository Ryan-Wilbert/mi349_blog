        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>I'm Ryan Wilbert, a student at Michigan State University studying Information Science. I am a passionate video editor/filmmaker as well as a researcher with an interest in technology and its relationship with society. I aim to bring all sorts of people together! I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself with a plethora of creative projects, ranging from screenplays to papers, constantly seeking out new stories to tell. </p>
        <p> My hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing poetry</li>
            <li>Reading sci-fi and fantasy</li>
            <li>Watching movies</li>
            <li>Playing guitar</li>
            <li>Producing music</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>On this site, you’ll find all sorts of tangents and rants of my own. I love to gush about music I love, new technology, and whatever book or movie I’m into at the time. If you find that sort of commotion interesting, stick around on my page and even reach out to me with any of your own ideas. Glad to have you here, and remember to have fun.</p>
